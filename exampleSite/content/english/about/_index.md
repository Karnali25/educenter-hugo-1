## About Our Journey

Est 2002, now 18 years in ICT, providing product, service & software support systems to Telcos / ISP’s.

Primary focus is delivering real operational efficiencies, while improving the ISP customer experience though active management of Customers modem/routers and other CPE.​ In 2011 Connectplay partnered with Netmania-IT to provide the New Zealand market with an entry level, full service TR-069 Auto Configuration Server, and deployed the largest ACS Enterprise platform in APAC with Spark New Zealand in 2017.

Understanding the limitations of current ACS platforms, ConnectPlay began development on “NEURON” a next generation Device Management platform for Services providers. In 2019 NEURON was successfully deployed into a number of Service Providers across the APAC region, including Telecom Fiji.

Working closely with NZ Internet Service Providers and Integrators, Connectplay develops and refines processes to improve the customer experience and "take the pain away" by reducing CPE deployment and Customer Support costs.
