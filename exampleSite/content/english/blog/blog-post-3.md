### 
The **Internet of Things** keeps on extending its venture into homes, organizations, social settings, and different environments, as an ever-increasing number of devices are communicating with each other to gathering and sharing staggering amounts of data.  There are a few great advantages of IoT from a consumer point of view. Aside from the convenience viewpoint, Smart connected devices can lead to expanded energy effectiveness, Improved security and safety, higher product quality and so on. 
 
### What is IoT Device Management?

The IoT device management is the process that involves provisioning, configuring, authenticating, maintaining, monitoring and diagnosing connected devices operating as part of an IoT environment to provide and support the whole spectrum of their functional capabilities. Reliable and effective device management is critical to establishing and maintaining the connectivity and security of smart assets.

### IoT Device Management fundamentals

The device needs to be taken care of as per some acknowledge standards and best practices that make up the IoT device management fundamentals. Any Internet of Things (IoT) device deployment requires four device management fundamentals:


* **Provsioning and authenticationg**
* **Configuration**
* **Monitoring and dianostics**
* **Software updates and maintanance**

There are billions of devices up and running on the internet worldwide, but each device had to be connected to the web for the first time. This process of enrollment of the device into the system is important for the whole enterprise at all stages in the future. Device authentication is the act of securely establishing the connection of the device to make sure that the device can be trusted. A cloud-hosted service needs yo know that the connected device is genuine, is running trustable software, and is used by the trusted user.  

Provisioning is the activity of enrolling a device into the system. Authentication is a part that activity, where device get registred with proper credentials. The provisioning process varies widely depends on implementation. In most of the applications, the device being deployed is configured with a certificate or key that identifies it as trusted and device present this credentials to the server and if it is trusted, it will receive further configuration data.

 As soon as the device finished provisioning, needs to start the configuration process. In most cases devices comes with preconfigure generic configuration provided by manufactures. It depends on the service provider to configure the device according to the deployment such as  location of the IoT environment, name /role they going to play in Iot ecosystem and device-specific settings. Sometimes end-users to have to do the further configuration process.


 In fleet management tracking we can set up grouping capabilities. There is a possibility to group the device automatically according to your needs. Some parameters need to write once the device is installed, such as the amount of time between sending apposition messages, are also programmed into the device. 



 To implement certain control capabilities into a system, you can remotely reset the device to accomplish a known-good state and recovers from mistakes and execute new configuration changes. You may need your device to be capable to reset to the factory default configuration. Which is useful when you want your device to perform within the scope of your IoT ecosystem. A flexible and inbuilt configuration mechanism enables you to design the functioning of your smart fleet, always even in any case of future failure as well.

 The monitoring and diagnostic feature are important for IoT device management. They are crucial to minimizing the impact of device downtime due to firmware bugs or any unexpected operation problems. Also, they are a useful factor in successful IoT device management. 

 
 As an example, you can detect when something is faulty by monitoring compute, networking, storage, and I/O statistics at the task or process level and contrasting those insights to characterized nominal values. Monitoring is about preventing failure from happening them counteracting them before they become harmful. Monitoring network statistics can also detect possible security breaches. IoT device management mostly use modern analytics mechanisms for creating useful statistics into issues that may emerge across your whole IoT deployment.

 Software maintenance and update are playing a vital role in IoT device management. User may not think, but the software may release with bugs in it, or that the scope of the project may change and new features and functionality may come in handy, or security vulnerabilities may come that pose a threat to devise deployment and you want securely provisioned and configured devices. However, this is the most important feature of  IoT device management- it is totally necessary to securely maintain and update remote device firmware. The Solution for this, comprehensive IoT device management provide an advanced mechanism for software updates and maintenance so every device keep secure and updated and bug-free.

 To fix software bugs, or add simple functionalities and save bandwidth of the network, the user just needs to run the software update without touching the platform firmware.  Software updates need to perform when there is a minimal business impact.
